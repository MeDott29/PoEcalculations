This is a repository I just started.
It is meant for generating a function.
The function must solve a problem by creating a graph.
We will adjust the graph as needed.
# ARPG Mechanics Update:
• Added new ARPG mechanics to the project.
• New calculations for synergy between projectile and target, as
  described by the given ARPG game mechanics, can be found in 'arpg_mechanics.py'.
