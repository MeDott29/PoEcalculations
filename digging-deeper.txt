we are developing functions for calculating effectiveness of a projectile hitting a target. the projectile and target are part of an ARPG game.

The interaction we are interested in is the synergy between these two concepts

-(20-40)% chance to gain a Frenzy Charge% chance to gain a Frenzy Charge for each Enemy you hit with a Critical Strike for each Enemy you hit with a Critical Strike

-Lose all Frenzy Charges on reaching Maximum Frenzy Charges to make the next Bow Attack you perform fire that many additional Arrows

we are looking to demonstrate the generation of additional arrows as a function of critical strike chance, hits, gain of frenzy charges over time

values that will have to be calculated include
bow attacks over time, arrows per bow attack, frenzy charges generated per attack
